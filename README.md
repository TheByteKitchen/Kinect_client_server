This system shows 'Kinect for Windows' data in a WinRT application. Using the keyboard, you can navigate through the scene that is registered by the Kinect.

It requires The Byte KItchen Libs to build.

See blog posts at TheByteKitchen.com for more information, typically:

"General information about the release" 

"About the filter for the depth jitter" 

"About very strong data compression for the Kinect" 


A precompiled client (3D-TV) is available from Windows Store
